## Here are a few of my favorite things:
* When the dog 🐶 bites
  * It is her way of giving kisses 💋
* When the bee 🐝 stings
  * Giving your life for your family is loyalty and love to the extreme and deserves to be honored
* When I am feeling mad 😠
  * Passion is a gift and having something you care enough about that you get upset over it is a gift 🎁
